To work with the Chrome browser using Selenium in Java, you need to set up your development environment and write Java code to automate tasks in the browser. Here are the steps to get you started:

**1. Set up your development environment:**

- Install Java: If you don't already have Java installed, you can download and install it from the official website (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- Install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. This will make it easier to write and run your Selenium scripts.

- Download the ChromeDriver executable that matches your Chrome browser version. You can download it from the official website (https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/).

- Create a new Java project in your chosen IDE.

**2. Add Selenium WebDriver dependency:**

In your Java project, you'll need to include the Selenium WebDriver library as a dependency. You can do this by adding the following Maven dependency to your project's pom.xml file (if you are using Maven):

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.seleniumhq.selenium</groupId>
        <artifactId>selenium-java</artifactId>
        <version>3.141.59</version> <!-- You can use the latest version available -->
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

If you're not using Maven, you can manually download the Selenium Java bindings and add the JAR files to your project.

**3. Write your Selenium code:**

Here's a basic example of how to open the Chrome browser, navigate to a website, and perform a simple action using Selenium in Java:

```java
import org.openqa.selenium.WebDriver;
import org.openqa.selenium.chrome.ChromeDriver;

public class ChromeAutomation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Set the path to the ChromeDriver executable
        System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "path/to/chromedriver.exe");

        // Create a new instance of the ChromeDriver
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();

        // Navigate to a website
        driver.get("https://www.example.com");

        // Perform actions, e.g., click a link or fill out a form

        // Close the browser
        driver.quit();
    }
}
```

Make sure to replace `"path/to/chromedriver.exe"` with the actual path to your ChromeDriver executable.

**4. Execute your Selenium script:**

Run your Java code using your IDE's run or debug feature. This will launch the Chrome browser and perform the automation tasks as specified in your code.

That's a basic overview of working with the Chrome browser using Selenium in Java. You can expand your script to perform more complex tasks, such as interacting with web elements, handling alerts, and more, depending on your automation requirements.
