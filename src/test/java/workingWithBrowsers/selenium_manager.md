## Selenium Manager
- Selenium Manager was introduced in Selenium 4.6.
- It simplifies the management of browser drivers in alignment with the installed browser version.
- The main issue resolved by Selenium Manager is the need to manually download and update browser drivers to match the installed browser version.
- As browser versions frequently undergo updates, manually updating drivers became a repetitive task.
- Selenium Manager automates the process of updating drivers, eliminating the need for manual updates based on browser version changes.
